# Optimizely C# SDK Changelog

## 3.4.1
April 29th, 2020

### Bug Fixes:
- Change FeatureVariable type from enum to string for forward compatibility. [#211](https://github.com/optimizely/csharp-sdk/pull/211)
- GetFeatureVariableDouble was returning 0 for FR culture. Fixed this issue by returning Invariant culture. [#209](https://github.com/optimizely/csharp-sdk/pull/209)

## 3.4.0
January 23rd, 2020

### New Features
- Added a new API to get a project configuration static data.
  - Call `GetOptimizelyConfig()` to get a snapshot copy of project configuration static data.
  - It returns an `OptimizelyConfig` instance which includes a datafile revision number, all experiments, and feature flags mapped by their key values.
  - Added caching for `GetOptimizelyConfig` - `OptimizelyConfig` object will be cached and reused for the lifetime of the datafile
  - For details, refer to a documentation page: https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/full-stack/docs/optimizelyconfig-csharp

### Bug Fixes:
- Blocking timeout was not being assigned. When not providing any value, it was just logging not setting up periodinterval and blocking timeout value. [#202](https://github.com/optimizely/csharp-sdk/pull/202)

## 3.3.0
September 26th, 2019

### New Features:
- Configuration manager is set to PollingProjectConfigManager and for datafile will be started by default. Requests to download and update datafile are made in a separate thread and are scheduled with fixed delay.
- Added support for event batching via the event processor.
- Events generated by methods like `Activate`, `Track`, and `IsFeatureEnabled` will be held in a queue until the configured batch size is reached, or the configured flush interval has elapsed. Then, they will be combined into a request and sent to the event dispatcher.
- To configure event batching, set the `MaxEventBatchSize` and `MaxEventFlushInterval` properties in the `OptimizelyFactory` using `OptimizelyFactory.SetBatchSize(int batchSize)` and `OptimizelyFactory.SetFlushInterval(TimeSpan flushInterval)` and then creating using `OptimizelyFactory.NewDefaultInstance`.
- Event batching is enabled by default. `eventBatchSize` defaults to `10`. `eventFlushInterval` defaults to `30000` milliseconds.
- Updated the `Dispose` method representing the process of closing the instance. When `Dispose` is called, any events waiting to be sent as part of a batched event request will be immediately batched and sent to the event dispatcher.
- If any such requests were sent to the event dispatcher, `Stop` waits for provided `TimeoutInterval` before stopping, so that events get successfully dispatched.
- `OptimizelyFactory` now provides support of setting configuration variables from ***App.config***, User will now be able to provide configuration variables of `HttpConfigManager` and `BatchEventProcessor` in ***App.config***. Steps of usage are provided in [README.md](https://github.com/optimizely/csharp-sdk#using-appconfig-in-optimizelyfactory).

### Deprecated
- `EventBuilder` was deprecated and now we will be using `UserEventFactory` and `EventFactory` to create LogEvent Object.
- Deprecated `Track` notifications in favor of explicit `LogEvent` notification.
- New features will no longer be supported on `.net standard 1.6` and `.net 3.5`

## 3.2.0
July 22nd, 2019

### New Features:
* Added support for automatic datafile management via `HttpProjectConfigManager` for framework 4.0 or above:
  * The [`HttpProjectConfigManager`](https://github.com/optimizely/csharp-sdk/blob/master/OptimizelySDK/Config/HttpProjectConfigManager.cs) is an implementation of the abstract
      [`PollingProjectConfigManager`](https://github.com/optimizely/csharp-sdk/blob/master/OptimizelySDK/Config/PollingProjectConfigManager.cs) class.
    - Users must first build the `HttpProjectConfigManager` with an SDK key and then and provide that instance to the `Optimizely` instance.
    - An initial datafile can be provided to the `HttpProjectConfigManager` to bootstrap before making HTTP requests for the hosted datafile.
    - Requests for the datafile are made in a separate thread and are scheduled with fixed delay.
    - Configuration updates can be subscribed to via the NotificationCenter built with the `HttpProjectConfigManager`.
    - `Optimizely` instance must be disposed after the use or `HttpProjectConfigManager` must be disposed after the use to release resources.
* The [`OptimizelyFactory`](https://github.com/optimizely/csharp-sdk/blob/master/OptimizelySDK/OptimizelyFactory.cs) provides basic methods for instantiating the Optimizely SDK with a minimal number of parameters. Check [`README.md`](https://github.com/optimizely/csharp-sdk#use-optimizelyfactory) for more details.

## 3.1.1
June 19th, 2019

### Bug Fixes:
* Build OptimizelySDK.NetStandard16.dll in Release mode

## 3.1.0
May 9th, 2019

### New Features:
* Introduced Decision notification listener to be able to record:
  * Variation assignments for users activated in an experiment.
  * Feature access for users.
  * Feature variable value for users.

### Bug Fixes:
* Feature variable APIs return default variable value when featureEnabled property is false. ([#151](https://github.com/optimizely/csharp-sdk/pull/151))

### Deprecated:
* Activate notification listener is deprecated as of this release. Recommendation is to use the new Decision notification listener. Activate notification listener will be removed in the next major release.

## 3.0.0
March 1st, 2019

The 3.0 release improves event tracking and supports additional audience targeting functionality.

### New Features:
* Event tracking:
  * The `track` method now dispatches its conversion event _unconditionally_, without first determining whether the user is targeted by a known experiment that uses the event. This may increase outbound network traffic.
  * In Optimizely results, conversion events sent by 3.0 SDKs don't explicitly name the experiments and variations that are currently targeted to the user. Instead, conversions are automatically attributed to variations that the user has previously seen, as long as those variations were served via 3.0 SDKs or by other clients capable of automatic attribution, and as long as our backend actually received the impression events for those variations.
  * Altogether, this allows you to track conversion events and attribute them to variations even when you don't know all of a user's attribute values, and even if the user's attribute values or the experiment's configuration have changed such that the user is no longer affected by the experiment. As a result, **you may observe an increase in the conversion rate for previously-instrumented events.** If that is undesirable, you can reset the results of previously-running experiments after upgrading to the 3.0 SDK.
  * This will also allow you to attribute events to variations from other Optimizely projects in your account, even though those experiments don't appear in the same datafile.
  * Note that for results segmentation in Optimizely results, the user attribute values from one event are automatically applied to all other events in the same session, as long as the events in question were actually received by our backend. This behavior was already in place and is not affected by the 3.0 release.
* Support for all types of attribute values, not just strings.
  * All values are passed through to notification listeners.
  * Strings, booleans, and valid numbers are passed to the event dispatcher and can be used for Optimizely results segmentation. A valid number is a finite number in the inclusive range [-2⁵³, 2⁵³].
  * Strings, booleans, and valid numbers are relevant for audience conditions.
* Support for additional matchers in audience conditions:
  * An `exists` matcher that passes if the user has a non-null value for the targeted user attribute and fails otherwise.
  * A `substring` matcher that resolves if the user has a string value for the targeted attribute.
  * `gt` (greater than) and `lt` (less than) matchers that resolve if the user has a valid number value for the targeted attribute. A valid number is a finite number in the inclusive range [-2⁵³, 2⁵³].
  * The original (`exact`) matcher can now be used to target booleans and valid numbers, not just strings.
* Support for A/B tests, feature tests, and feature rollouts whose audiences are combined using `"and"` and `"not"` operators, not just the `"or"` operator.
* Datafile-version compatibility check: The SDK will remain uninitialized (i.e., will gracefully fail to activate experiments and features) if given a datafile version greater than 4.
* Updated Pull Request template and commit message guidelines.
### Breaking Changes:
* Conversion events sent by 3.0 SDKs don't explicitly name the experiments and variations that are currently targeted to the user, so these events are unattributed in raw events data export. You must use the new _results_ export to determine the variations to which events have been attributed.
* `UserAttributes` objects, which are passed to API methods and returned to notification listeners, can now contain non-string values. More concretely, `UserAttributes` now extends `Dictionary<string, object>` instead of `Dictionary<string, string>`.
### Bug Fixes:
* Experiments and features can no longer activate when a negatively targeted attribute has a missing, null, or malformed value. ([#132](https://github.com/optimizely/csharp-sdk/pull/132))
  * Audience conditions (except for the new `exists` matcher) no longer resolve to `false` when they fail to find an legitimate value for the targeted user attribute. The result remains `null` (unknown). Therefore, an audience that negates such a condition (using the `"not"` operator) can no longer resolve to `true` unless there is an unrelated branch in the condition tree that itself resolves to `true`.
* `SetForcedVariation` now treats an empty variation key as invalid and does not reset the variation. ([#113](https://github.com/optimizely/csharp-sdk/pull/113))
* All methods now treat an empty user ID as valid.
* `HttpClientEventDispatcher45` now logs full exception ([#112](https://github.com/optimizely/csharp-sdk/pull/112))
* You can now specify `0` or `1` as the `revenue` or `value` for a conversion event when using the `Track` method. Previously, `0` and `1` were withheld, would not appear in your data export, and in the case of `1` would not contribute to the user's total revenue or value.

## 2.0.0
April 16, 2018

This major release of the Optimizely SDK introduces APIs for Feature Management.

### New Features
* Introduces the `IsFeatureEnabled` API to determine whether to show a feature to a user or not.
```
var enabled = OptimizelyClient.IsFeatureEnabled("my_feature_key", "user_1", userAttributes);
```

* You can also get all the enabled features for the user by calling the following method which returns a list of strings representing the feature keys:
```
var enabledFeatures = OptimizelyClient.GetEnabledFeatures("user_1", userAttributes);
```

* Introduces Feature Variables to configure or parameterize your feature. There are four variable types: `Integer`, `String`, `Double`, `Boolean`.
```
var stringVariable = OptimizelyClient.GetFeatureVariableString("my_feature_key", "string_variable_key", "user_1", userAttributes);
var integerVariable = OptimizelyClient.GetFeatureVariableInteger("my_feature_key", "integer_variable_key", "user_1", userAttributes);
var doubleVariable = OptimizelyClient.GetFeatureVariableDouble("my_feature_key", "double_variable_key", "user_1", userAttributes);
var booleanVariable = OptimizelyClient.GetFeatureVariableBoolean("my_feature_key", "boolean_variable_key", "user_1", userAttributes);
```
