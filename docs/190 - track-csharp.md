Tracks a conversion event. Logs an error message if the specified event key doesn't match any existing events.

  "title": "Description"
}
[/block]
Use this method to track events across multiple experiments. You should only send one tracking event per conversion, even if many feature tests or A/B tests are measuring it.

  "type": "info",
  "title": "Note",
  "body": "Events are counted in an experiment when an impression was sent as a result of the [Activate](doc:activate-csharp) or [Is Feature Enabled](doc:is-feature-enabled-csharp) method being called."
}

The attributes passed to Track are only used for [results segmentation](doc:analyze-results#section-segment-results).
